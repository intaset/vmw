 <p class="body">Often described as the &quot;Little  Paris of Middle Europe&quot;, Budapest is famous not only for the monuments  reflecting its own 1,000-year-old culture, but also for the relics of others  who settled here. Remains from both Roman occupation and much later ruled by the  Turks can still be seen in the city. After the Ottoman Empire the union with  Austria has a particular influence on the city's form and style.</p>
 <p class="body">The capital has two sides, Buda and  Pest, stretching along the banks of the Danube, representing two different  characters of the city.<br>
  Suburban Buda and its historic castle  district offer medieval streets and houses, museums, caves and Roman ruins. The  dynamic Pest side boasts the largest parliament building in Europe, riverside  promenades, flea markets, bookstores, antique stores and café houses.</p>
  <p class="body">
  Budapest has a lot to offer. Museums  and galleries, churches and synagogues, palaces and historic buildings, baths  and pools are presented together with the influence of Secession in the city.</p>
